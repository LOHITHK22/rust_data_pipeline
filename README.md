This Rust-based data pipeline is designed to handle data ingestion, analysis, and storage, specifically using CSV data as input and PostgreSQL for data storage. It leverages the Polars library for efficient DataFrame manipulation, allowing for reading, analyzing, and transforming data. The pipeline begins by ingesting customer segmentation data from a CSV file, followed by performing basic statistical analysis such as calculating means, standard deviations, and min/max values of numeric columns while skipping specific columns like gender and preferred category. The statistical analysis results are printed for review.

After analyzing the data, the pipeline stores it into a PostgreSQL database. Using SQLx for asynchronous database interaction, it creates a customer_data table if it doesn't exist and inserts each row from the DataFrame into the database. The entire flow is designed to be robust, with error handling powered by the anyhow crate to manage potential issues during data ingestion, analysis, or storage.

Additionally, the pipeline includes data visualization using Tableau, which helps in presenting the analysis results in an interactive and understandable manner. It is designed with modularity in mind, with distinct modules for ingestion, analysis, storage, and visualization, making it flexible and extensible for future enhancements. It also includes unit tests for validating the CSV reading functionality and basic statistical operations, ensuring code reliability.
